Welcome to Logical Simulator **v1.1**! We are excited to release a big _user-interface focused_ update with many new features, improvements, and bug fixes, including:

- Improved user interfaces for a more user-friendly experience. (Oh those IC pin configurations were _confusing_.)
- Dark mode, so you can stop burning your eyes. You can find the theme switcher in the navigation bar.
- Buffers and clocks can accept either update cycles or milliseconds now!
- Markdown support in notes. Links, images, code, and more work too! (So watch out for what you click in user-generated content!) Check out the documentation for the note to see what Markdown we support.
- A blog!

And as usual, there have been bug fixes in the simulator and this time, in the Logical importer as well.

The home page was also massively improved, now you have beautiful cards documentating features instead of images each with a different aspect ratio. Like I swear, who took those pictures... \*~~Refuses to check the file history~~\*

We can't wait to hear your feedback!
