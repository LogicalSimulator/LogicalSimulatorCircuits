  The 8-bit memory cell uses 8 D flip-flops, which can each store 1 bit. By
  using 8 of them in an IC, we can store 1 byte of memory. This version also
  includes D flip-flops with manual set and reset inputs, so therefore the 8-bit
  memory cell exposes the set and reset pins, which can set all or clear all of
  the cells.
