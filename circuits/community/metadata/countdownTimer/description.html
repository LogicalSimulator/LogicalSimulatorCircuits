  A simple eight-bit timer that can count down, with a range of 256 to 1 second.
  It uses an eight-bit adder/subtractor and two eight-bit memory cells to store
  the time remaining. Make sure to move to the bottom left in order to find the
  "UI."

<p>
  To operate the timer, set the switch to the "set time" mode. (off) Input your
  time (seconds) in binary. Set the switch to "count down" mode. (on) The
  corresponding lights will turn on to indicate the mode and time (seconds) left
  in binary. To use it again, repeat these steps. You must switch modes to reset
  the memory.
