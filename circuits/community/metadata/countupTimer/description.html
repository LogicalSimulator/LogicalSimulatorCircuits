  A simple eight-bit timer that can count up, with a maximum of 255 seconds. It
  uses an eight-bit adder/subtractor and two eight-bit memory cells to store the
  time remaining. Make sure to move to the bottom left in order to find the
  "UI."

  To operate the timer, turn on the counting switch. Use the reset button to
  reset the memory and start from 0 again.
